Use "pip install <package>" or "pip3 install <package>" on your command line to download the keyboard package for python. 
 
This program will start the user with randomized amount of capital and offer you to buy stocks in random companies. For convenience, the program also calculates the maximum amount of shares you can buy in that company using your capital. If you enter a number higher than the maximum share threshold, the program will stop and ask you to try again. 

After you have bought shares within a company, the price of the stock will move up and down, mirroring the fluctuation in the actual market. You can change or play around with the volatility within the program. 

At any point, you can press 's' on your keyboard in order to sell your shares. The program will then take the last price of your shares and calculate the profit and return of your investment.
